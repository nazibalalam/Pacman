# Pacman with python

This is a simple pacman game which I'm currently working on

In order to start the game, you must first:
    + install [pygame](https://pypi.org/project/pygame/)

Then run the file called `main.py`

Known bugs:
    + the game freezes after few seconds the game has loaded

Feel free to raise [new issues](https://github.com/JagTheFriend/Pacman/issues), and/or <br> create [pull requests](https://github.com/JagTheFriend/Pacman/pulls) if you are able to find more bugs or <br> fix the existing ones
